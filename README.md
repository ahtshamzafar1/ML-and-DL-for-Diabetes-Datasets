# Time Series Data Analysis
 
# Interactable plots 
The python notebook demonstrates a better visualization technique for on-the-go interation with the data, as compared to fixed non-moveable plots.
You can use pre-defined time frame buttons for quick zooming into particular parts of data. Along with these buttons the horizontal slider with zooming functionality can be used to narrow the search area as per application requirement. 

# Stationarity - Decomposition - Periodicity
The Notebook contains multiple attributes including following:
1. To check stationarity of the data using ADF and KPSS tests.
2. To decompose data into components (seasonal / trend / residual) to analyze variability in data.
3. Autocorrelation plots
4. Moving average plots
5. To Analyze if there exists some periodicity in data, and what interval the periodicity is valid. 

# ARIMA
The python note is a complete workflow for implementation of ARIMA Model. 
The Components of notebook include:
1. Import Data
2. Clean and convert data
3. Visualize data
4. Analyze data for different dataframe sizes (Stationarity - Seasonality - Periodicity)
5. Apply ARIMA on different data frames. Arima parameters are estimated using ACF and PACF graphs.
6. Estimate error metrics for original and predicted data. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
